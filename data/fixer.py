This module uses data taken from -> https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/14793990/TzmCgD9k

The api before mentioned has an application error and it cannot be opened in web
so I brought the data to a JSON file ("raw_data.json") so that we can work with no problems.

We'll only modify the color values of all elements and change the keys to upper case.
After that, a new JSON file is created with the new information that we'll use for the rest of the project.
