# periodic-table-v2.0
A remade version of my periodic table python project using JSON files and OOP.

I used the same API data as the previous project version, but I had some problems with the conextion so I brought all elements information to a JSON file and that's how I continued improving this project.
The biggest differences of this version to the previous are:
  1. OOP applied.
  2. Element information shown in a new Tkinter window.
  3. Dimensions values gotten by algorithms.

I separated all files (except 'main.py') in folders for a better organization. I included the JSON file (in '/data') that I got from the API and also python file that generates the JSON file used for this project.
Each python file has some comments that explain how I did stuff. This project was made in Fedora 37.
I hope this version is stronger than previous for dimensions adaptation in others operating systems. I tried to write the code as the cleanest way possible, I also tried to explain in the code comments in the clearest way possible so I hope you understand all stuff.

That's all. I hope you like my work, feel free to ask anything you want and use this program as you want.
