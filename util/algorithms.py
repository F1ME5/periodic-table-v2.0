'''
This module contains two funcionts that set values used as dimensions.
'''

from util.constants import C_0, C_1

'''
This funtion is used to generate a tuple that contains all integer values
for place buttons horizontally and vertically in the window.

All 'x' and 'y' buttons positions were set by constants increasings
and other values that are defined in "element.py".

Those parameters are set in 'dimensions.py'.
'''

    positions = []

    x = begin #First 'x'
    positions.append(x) #First 'x' appended
    for i in range(max): #It'll repeat 'max' times
        x += increasing #Next 'x' is equal to previous 'x' plus increasing
        positions.append(x) #Next 'x' appended

    if flag:#We're working with 'y_positions' (used in element.py)

        positions[max - C_1] += Y_CORRECTION #Lanthanoids
        positions[max] += Y_CORRECTION #Actinoids

'''
This function is used to get the periods and groups labels positions.
The two collections received as parameters were created in 'dimensions.py' using 'get_positions()'.
